# LLama 4 - Form Flow: Revolutionizing Form Navigation with AI

Filling out complex forms can be a daunting task, especially for those with limited proficiency in the dominant language of their region. We developed an innovative solution, leveraging the capabilities of Llama 4, to guide users through the process with ease.


## Our Solution

Our application is a cutting-edge, user-centric tool that utilizes Llama 4's Maverick model to analyze and understand complex forms. By uploading a form image, users can access a personalized, step-by-step guide to completing the form in their preferred language.

## Technical Overview

Our tech stack consists of a lightweight React frontend and a FastAPI backend, harnessing the power of Llama 4 for two primary purposes: analysis and conversation.

Analysis: Our /form/start endpoint employs Llama 4 to:

- Analyze form images (PDFs, PNGs, etc.)
- Identify input fields and understand their context
- Normalize field labels (e.g., "First Name" or "Social Security Number")
- Return pixel bounds for highlighting relevant fields on the frontend

Conversation: Our /form/next and /form/respond endpoints utilize Llama 4 to:

- Guide users through the form, field by field, in their preferred language
-Leverage conversation history and field context to provide accurate and relevant responses
-Offer additional context when users ask questions about specific fields
-Addressing the Problem Statements

Our project directly addresses two key problem statements:

***Long Context Applications:*** By utilizing Llama 4's large context window, our application can remember earlier answers and refer back to them, ensuring a seamless and accurate form-filling experience.

***Native Multimodality + Multilinguality:*** Our app synthesizes information from both image and text, using Llama 4's multimodal capabilities to analyze form images and provide multilingual support.

## Key Highlights

- Innovative use of Llama 4: Our application showcases the capabilities of Llama 4's Maverick model in a real-world scenario.

- Multilingual support: Users can access the form guide in their preferred language, breaking down language barriers.

- Personalized experience: Our application provides a tailored experience for each user, adapting to their needs and questions.

## Demo and Impact

Our demo showcases the effectiveness of our solution, demonstrating how Llama 4 can be used to create a user-friendly and accessible form-filling experience. We believe our project has significant long-term potential for success, growth, and impact, particularly in regions with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
